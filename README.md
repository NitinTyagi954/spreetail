## Features

### Group & Member Management
- Create groups with a backdated `joinedAt` date (supports historical imports)
- Add members by email (registered users) or by name (creates guest account)
- Remove members by setting a `leftAt` date — membership history is preserved
- Edit join/leave dates at any time via the dashboard

### Date-bounded Memberships
- Every expense validates that payer and all split participants were **active members on the expense date**
- Active = `joinedAt ≤ expenseDate AND (leftAt IS NULL OR leftAt ≥ expenseDate)`
- Inactive participants are flagged at import time and blocked at expense creation time

### Expense Management
- 4 split types: **EQUAL**, **UNEQUAL**, **PERCENTAGE**, **SHARE**
- Multi-currency: USD and INR supported (live exchange rate at import time)
- Refund tracking (`isRefund` flag) reverses a payer's balance contribution
- Full ledger view per member (chronological: what they paid, what they owed, net impact)

### Settlement Tracking
- Record direct payments between members
- Settlements are separate from expenses and apply directly to balances

### Balance Calculation
- Per-member `totalPaid`, `totalOwed`, and `netBalance` in INR
- USD splits converted using stored `exchangeRate` per expense (`split.amount × rate`)
- Greedy debt simplification: minimum number of transfers to settle all debts

### CSV Import (Meera's Rule: user approves every change)
- Upload raw `expenses_export.csv` without editing it first
- 13+ anomaly types detected automatically
- Every flagged row shown with description + suggested action
- [Approve] [Reject] [Modify] controls per anomaly
- "Approve All" button for auto-approvable anomalies
- Finalize commits all decisions atomically in a single transaction

---

## CSV Import — How It Works

The importer runs a **Parse → Detect → Review → Commit** pipeline:

### Step 1: Upload (`POST /api/imports/upload`)
- CSV file is parsed into typed row objects
- Live USD/INR exchange rate is fetched and attached to USD rows
- Anomaly detection runs against all rows + group membership records
- An `ImportSession` and `ImportAnomaly` records are saved to the database
- Frontend receives: `{ session, rows, exchangeRate }`

### Step 2: User Reviews Anomalies
- Frontend renders a table of all flagged anomalies
- User works through each row: Approve the suggestion / Reject the row / Modify inline
- `POST /api/imports/anomalies/:id/resolve` records each decision
- Stats update live: Total Rows | Manual Review | Correct Rows | Ready to Import

### Step 3: Finalize (`POST /api/imports/finalize`)
- All resolved row objects sent to backend
- Committed inside a **single Prisma transaction** (all or nothing)
- Names resolved to User records; guest accounts created for external members
- Expenses, splits, and settlements written to the database
- `ImportSession` status set to `COMPLETED`

## Data Problems Detected (13+)

> **Full policy documentation:** See [IMPORTER_POLICY.md](./IMPORTER_POLICY.md)

| # | Type | What It Catches | Policy |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `DUPLICATE` | Same date + description → exact or conflicting copy | Flag both types; user approves discard |
| 2 | `SETTLEMENT` | Keywords: settle/repay/paid back in description/notes | Suggest `CONVERT_TO_SETTLEMENT` |
| 3 | `NEGATIVE_AMOUNT` | amount < 0 | Suggest `MARK_AS_REFUND`; sets `isRefund = true` |
| 4 | `ZERO_AMOUNT` | amount = 0 | Suggest `SKIP_ROW` |
| 5 | `MISSING_CURRENCY` | currency column blank | Suggest `DEFAULT_TO_INR` |
| 6 | `MISSING_PAYER` | paid_by blank | **Blocking** — user must assign payer or reject |
| 7 | `INVALID_DATE` | Date cannot be parsed at all | **Blocking** — user must provide valid date |
| 8 | `AMBIGUOUS_DATE` | `XX/YY/YYYY` where both XX≤12 and YY≤12 | Show 2 format buttons; user picks DD/MM or MM/DD |
| 9 | `NAME_MISMATCH` | Casing, spaces, abbreviation (e.g. "priya", "Priya S") | Fuzzy match via Levenshtein distance; user approves |
| 10 | `MEMBERSHIP_VIOLATION` | Expense date outside member's join-leave window | Remove inactive participant or adjust window |
| 11 | `SPLIT_CONFLICT` | `split_type=EQUAL` but split_details populated | Override split_type to SHARE |
| 12 | `PERCENTAGE_MISMATCH` | Percentages sum ≠ 100% | Auto-normalize proportionally; show result before approve |
| 13 | `EXTERNAL_MEMBER` | Name in split_with not found in group | Create guest user on finalize |
| 14 | `AMOUNT_FORMAT` | Amount has commas (e.g. `"1,200"`) | Strip commas, show parsed value |

## API Reference

All endpoints except `/auth/register` and `/auth/login` require:
```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

### Auth
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | Register new user → returns `{ token, user }` |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | Login → returns `{ token, user }` |

### Groups

| GET | `/api/groups` | List all groups for authenticated user |
| GET | `/api/groups/:id` | Get group details with all membership records |
| POST | `/api/groups/:id/members` | Add member by email or name (guest) |
| PUT | `/api/groups/:id/members/:userId` | Update member's joinedAt / leftAt |
| DELETE | `/api/groups/:id/members/:userId` | Set member's leftAt (soft-remove) |
| GET | `/api/groups/:id/balances` | Calculate balances + suggested settlements |

---

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (uses native `fetch`)
- A Neon PostgreSQL database (free tier works)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Spreetree

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend && npm install

# Install frontend dependencies  
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

### 2. Configure backend `.env`

Create `backend/.env`:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@ep-xxx-pooler.region.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://user:pass@ep-xxx.region.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
```

> **Important:** `DATABASE_URL` should be the **pooler** URL. `DIRECT_URL` must be the **direct** (non-pooler) URL. Prisma uses `DIRECT_URL` for `$transaction` operations which require a persistent connection.

### 3. Run migrations

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate
```

### 4. Start servers

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Backend (port 5000)
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — Frontend (port 5173)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

### 5. Run integration tests

```bash
# Full CSV import flow integration test
cd backend
node verify-importer.js

# API endpoint smoke tests
node verify-endpoints.js
```

## Database Setup

### Schema Overview

```
User ──────────┬── GroupMembership (joinedAt, leftAt) ──── Group
               ├── ExpenseSplit ──── Expense ──────────────── Group
               ├── Settlement ──────────────────────────────── Group
               └── ImportSession ── ImportAnomaly
```

### Key Tables

**`GroupMembership`** — Date-bounded, not boolean:
```sql
groupId   UUID  REFERENCES Group
userId    UUID  REFERENCES User
joinedAt  TIMESTAMP
leftAt    TIMESTAMP nullable   -- null = still active
```

**`Expense`** — Multi-currency aware:
```sql
amount       FLOAT   -- original amount (USD/INR)
currency     STRING  -- 'USD' or 'INR'
amountInINR  FLOAT   -- converted INR value (stored at import time)
exchangeRate FLOAT   -- rate used (e.g. 95.18 for USD→INR)
isRefund     BOOLEAN -- true = subtracts from balances
```

**`ExpenseSplit`** — Per-participant share:
```sql
expenseId  UUID
userId     UUID
amount     FLOAT   -- raw share in the expense's original currency
percentage FLOAT   -- if PERCENTAGE split
shares     INT     -- if SHARE split
```

**`ImportSession`** → tracks each CSV upload lifecycle  
**`ImportAnomaly`** → each flagged row and its resolution

## Key Design Decisions

Full decision log with rationale: [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md)

| Decision | Chosen Approach |
|---|---|
| Database | PostgreSQL — relational structure requires foreign keys & joins |
| ORM | Prisma 7 — schema-first, readable migrations, adapter for Neon |
| Membership tracking | `joinedAt + leftAt` per record — answers "was active on date X?" |
| Negative amounts | `isRefund = true` — reverses balance contribution inline |
| Missing payer | Block import — no safe default; payer = who gets reimbursed |
| Duplicate handling | Flag all for user approval (Meera's Rule) |
| Currency | Fetch live rate at upload time; store `amountInINR` per expense |
| Percentage normalization | Auto-normalize proportionally; show result before user approves |
| External members | Create `isGuest = true` user on finalize |
| Import flow | Review-and-confirm pipeline (not one-shot, not pre-edit required) |
| Split conflict | `split_details` overrides `split_type` label |
| Float rounding | Remainder goes to largest share |
| Debt simplification | Greedy algorithm — minimizes number of transfers |
| Transaction isolation | Sequential writes in 90s-timeout Prisma transaction (no parallel) |
